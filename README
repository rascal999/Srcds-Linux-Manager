SLM - Srcds Linux Manager

SLM eases administration of srcd servers. When I ran Gmod servers in the past I found that once every few days the server would crash and require a manual restart.

SLM also supports plugins which work by parsing log files to interact with players in-game. Example plugins are provided, including a profanity plugin.
